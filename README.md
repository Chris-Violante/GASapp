## Store Your Gear

Music enthusiasts often suffer from something called GAS - “Gear Acquisition Syndrome”. This is a problem that manifests as buying more music gear than any one person can need in a lifetime, many times over!  

The traditional ways of logging and maintaining an inventory over all   that gear (and knowing when your bassist swipes a few of your pedals) are many, and none are simple or intuitive.

We set out to create a place to store and evaluate all of one’s music gear in one, easy to access place online where reviews and valuations on each piece of gear can be found.
